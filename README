SUMMARY
=======

GOALS-logger is a broadcast audio logging system, optimised for 
capturing sports commentaries and extracting highlights
for rebroadcast or republishing.

Multiple users may simultaneously access the system, via it's browser-
based interface.

Server-side code is written in Perl and makes use of the Catalyst Web
Framework. Audio recording is via Nick Humphrey's rotter program.
Audio compilation and waveform drawing is via Paul Kelly's audiograph
and rotjoin programs.

The system is designed to register event inputs via an external GPIO
interface. This allows, for example, a football commentator to press
a button whenever a goal is scored. Audio associated with this event
may then be quickly accessed and edited for rebroadcast.

The system operates with uncompressed WAV or losslessly compressed 
FLAC audio file formats and is therefore designed to be accessed over
a high speed local network, rather than over a slow internet connection.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

GOALS-logger has been developed for installation on a machine running
Ubuntu 12.04, but is expected to work on most contemporary Linux
distributions. It uses JACK as an audio server for recording and makes
use of Upstart to manage the required daemon processes.


BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
=====================

GOALS-logger was developed for use with the Chrome browser, with which
it has been developed and tested. It is believed to work with Firefox
and other standards-compliant browsers supporting SVG, javascript and
the HTML audio element.

When last tested, it was found to be incompatible with Internet Explorer,
primarily due to limitations in that browser's support for SVG.


MATURITY
========

This software is in daily use at a national radio station in the UK,
where it has proved to be stable, reliable and easy to use. Subjectively,
as the author, I feel there remain a number of rough edges to be polished 
in terms of look, feel and styling - this work is ongoing.


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
==================

I welcome patches or suggestions for improvements or new functionality.
Further development will most likely be driven by the commercial 
requirements of NP Broadcast clients.


SUPPORT
=======

Commercial (paid-for) support is available from NP Broadcast Limited,
who can provide fully managed, monitored  and installed systems, 
customisations, and extensions.
