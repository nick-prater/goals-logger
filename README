SUMMARY
=======

GOALS-logger is a broadcast audio logging system, optimised for 
capturing sports commentaries and extracting highlights
for rebroadcast or republishing.

Multiple users may simultaneously access the system, via it's browser-
based interface.

Server-side code is written in Perl and makes use of the Catalyst Web
Framework. Audio recording is via Nick Humphrey's rotter program.
Audio compilation and waveform drawing is via Paul Kelly's audiograph
and rotjoin programs.

The system is designed to register event inputs via an external GPIO
interface. This allows, for example, a football commentator to press
a button whenever a goal is scored. Audio associated with this event
may then be quickly accessed and edited for rebroadcast.

The system operates with uncompressed WAV or losslessly compressed 
FLAC audio file formats and is therefore designed to be accessed over
a high speed local network, rather than over a slow internet connection.
